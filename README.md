# Lua Formatter

This is a simple and short script to format Lua codes.

Usage:

`python lua_format.py <path>`

and it will do reformat for all Lua scripts in `<path>`. You can do test on `lua_script.lua` by doing `python lua_format.py .`

*WARNING*

Formatting will be done inplace. i.e. It will **OVERWRITE** your original codes. Make sure you have a backup!
